## Bibliography of Periodical Literature on American Watercolor, c. 1860–1925

Many contemporary exhibition reviews and artist studies from newspapers and journals in the period of the American watercolor movement were quoted in American Watercolor in the Age of Homer and Sargent. These sources were cited in the notes, but not gathered into the selected bibliography published in the book (see .pdf above), in part because of the length of this compilation and also because of its potential for expansion on line. A bibliography of periodical literature has been compiled separately on the Zotero.org website, which offers free and easy-to-use software to those who register and download the software. The Philadelphia Museum of Art’s bibliography can be found at

[https://www.zotero.org/groups/174515/items](https://www.zotero.org/groups/174515/items)

The Zotero software allows searching and sorting, and ways to download citations in a variety of formats. As new bibliography is discovered, it will be added to the Zotero site by the PMA. Individual users cannot alter or add entries, but we would appreciate contributions of new references that we can add to this collective bibliography. Please contact [Americanartinfo@philamuseum.org](Americanartinfo@philamuseum.org) if you have suggestions or discover errors.

For those who cannot or choose not to use the Zotero site, the bibliography of contemporary periodical literature on American watercolor has been downloaded as a document in three sortings: in chronological order (grouped by year), and alphabetically by publication and author, if known.

## Catalogues of the Annual Exhibitions of the American Watercolor Society

The foundation of the American Watercolor Society (AWS) in December of 1866 launched a series of annual exhibitions the following year, initially in conjunction with the Winter Exhibition of the National Academy of Design (NAD) in New York. Beginning in 1874, when the Winter Exhibitions ceased, the AWS organized these annuals independently, for about twenty-five years at the NAD and then in other locations. No library holds a complete run of these catalogues, and they have never been indexed, so we have gathered or created digital scans from the first exhibition in 1867/68 to 1921-1922, when the AWS began to exhibit jointly with the New York Water Color Club. The earliest catalogues are not indexed, and the entries for the AWS galleries were at first merged within the larger roster of exhibitors in the Winter Exhibition. To help sort out the watercolor artists, an index for the years 1866/67 to 1922, prepared by Amy Torbert,  will also be included below (coming soon).

We are grateful to the holders of the original catalogues, the Frick Art Reference Library, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Winterthur Library, [and others: TK].

## Members of the American Watercolor Society, 1866-1922

A list of the complete membership of the American Watercolor Society (AWS), through 1969, appears in Ralph Fabri, A History of the American Watercolor Society: The First Hundred Years (New York: AWS, 1969), pp. 88–90. The omissions and errors in this listing inspired a new roster, drawing from the minutes of the AWS as well as the annual catalogues. Published in American Watercolor in the Age of Homer and Sargent (2017) as Appendix B, compiled by Cynthia Veloric, pp. 389–91, it is excerpted in a .pdf below. The roster includes artists joining from 1866 to 1922, embracing the influx of new members elected in 1921 and 1922 as the AWS began to exhibit jointly with the New York Water Color Club.

Appendix A from this book (p. 388), listing the members of the earlier New York Water Color Society (1850-55), which included many later members to the AWS, was compiled by Sally Mills; see .jpg below.

## Watercolor Techniques and Materials

The general bibliography described above includes many sources on watercolor techniques and materials, including invaluable analysis by paper conservators Marjorie Cohn, Kristi Dahm, Antoinette Owen, Marjorie Shelley, and Judith Walsh.

An essay by Rebecca Pollak, “Flash in the Pan: A History of Manufacturing Watercolor Pigments in America,” appears in American Watercolor in the Age of Homer and Sargent (2017), pp. 375–87. A .pdf of that essay appears below:

## Acknowledgments

These resources have been gathered by Kathleen A. Foster over the course of many years studying American watercolor painting. More recently, she has been assisted in building and organizing these research tools by many in the department of American Art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, including Emily Leischner and Cynthia Veloric, and fellows at the Center for American Art, including Barra Fellows Laura Fravel, Jennifer Stettler Parsons, Naomi Slipp, and Amy Torbert, who shouldered the largest burden pulling all the material together in 2017; and Summer Fellows Caitlin Beach, James Denison, Abby Eron, Ramey Mize, Lauren Palmor, Corey Piper, Melanie Saeck, and Brittany Strupp. Sally Mills, research assistant at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Visual Arts, National Gallery of Art, also helped build the bibliography and contributed the roster of the New York Water Color Society. We are grateful to other museum staffers who helped organize this site, including Kristen Regina, Cynthia Rodriguez, and Ariel Schwarz. [and others]
