Welcome to the Philadelphia Museum of Artâ€™s research portal for the study of American watercolors. Organized in conjunction with the exhibition, American Watercolor in the Age of Homer and Sargent and its catalogue of the same title by Kathleen A. Foster (Philadelphia Museum of Art and Yale University Press, 2017), this site brings together supplementary materials, including a bibliography of periodical literature, a collection of catalogues for the exhibitions of the American Watercolor Society and other related publications, and information about watercolor materials and techniques. We hope these resources will encourage additional work on the ninety-three artists in the exhibition and the hundreds more who deserve study.
